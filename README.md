# Project1-The Paws Button
This is the second project completed as part of a Software Engineer Immersive course at GA Sydney. The purpose of this project was to build a web application from scratch, based on basic back-end knowledge such as CRUD and database.

'The Paws Button' is a web application where animal rescue centres can sign up and advertise animals they have available for adoption. Users can also sign up and browse the adoptable animals, or get information about the animal rescue centres.
